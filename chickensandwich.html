    <p><b>Ingredients(sandwich):</b> Boneless skinless chicken breast, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 egg, 3 finely minced garlic cloves, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp hot sauce, buns</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients(sauce):</b> 3/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 cloves garlic, grated on microplane or minced finely, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp finely diced dill pickles, 1 tbsp finely diced parsley</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients(dredge):</b> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup cornstarch, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon smoked paprika, 2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients(Spicy oil sauce):</b> 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup duck fat, 3 tablespoons super hot cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper</p>
    <P><b>Making the Sandwich:</b> Once the chicken has been pounded thin and brined for 4+ hours, take 3-4 tablespoons of the brine and add it to the dredge mixture. Run your fingers through this until they have mixed together and made little pellets in the dredge, this is a secret tip that will give you a super craggy outer crust on the chicken. Pull the chicken out of the buttermilk brine and put it into the dredge, coating all sides. Fry at 375 degrees for 5-7 minutes until the chicken thighs read 170 internal on an instant thermometer. Pull the chicken from the fryer, brush or toss with your spicy duck fat sauce (make sure the sauce is hot) and place on your toasted buns with your comeback sauce and pickles. Would be great with some shredded cabbage or slaw too. Enjoy your sandwich and the pain that ensues.</P>
